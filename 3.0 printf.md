The header file stdio.h controls the defination of the function printf.
stdio stands for standard input output and here the standard input is reffered to keyboard and standard output is reffered to as monitor.
standard output instructions are for printing something on screen.

printf() - printf is not a keyword, its a function.
printf() is used to print messages on screen; here the messages can be of two types:
----> printing text as it is.
----> printing value of expression or value of variable.

*** Declaration statements are always performed before the action statements

printing text as it is
int main()
{
printf("hello world");
return 0;
}

printing value of expression
int main()
{
int x=7, y=8;
printf("sum of %d and %d is %d", x,y,x+y);
return 0;
}

printing value of variable
int main()
{
int x=5;
printf("%d",x);
return 0;
}

Format specifiers
symbols starting with % are known as format specifiers, they don't get themselves printed but help data to get printed.
%d - int
%f - float
%c - character
%lf - double
